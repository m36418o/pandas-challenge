# MMORPG Purchase Data Analysis
## Summary
This exercise was completed in collaboration with Ashley Parra (AP).

Take a dive into the world of gamming. In video games, especially those of MMORPG, the economy of the game revolves around player(s) ingame decisions. Whether to sell, buy, or trade, it's all up to the player(s). In this simulated gaming data, I aimed to analyze the purchasing pattern of the players in the dataset, and provide a look into the relationship between gender and purchase decisions.

This was built using primarily Python and Pandas library in Jupyter Notebook.
